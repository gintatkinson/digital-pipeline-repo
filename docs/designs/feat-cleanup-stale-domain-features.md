# Solution Walkthrough: Cleanup of Stale Domain Features

This document details the cleanup of stale domain feature specifications and outlines the architectural alignment with the pipeline's dynamic layout and validation systems.

## 1. Overview of Changes

To align the specification model with the pipeline's modern architecture, we have removed several outdated static domain feature files from the backlog.

### Deleted Specification Files
The following static specification files have been removed:
* **`docs/features/feat-06-physical-structural.md`**
* **`docs/features/feat-07-physical-geographic-location.md`**
* **`docs/features/feat-08-rack-infrastructure.md`**
* **`docs/features/feat-09-distributed-chassis-containment.md`**

## 2. Architectural Rationale

The removal of these static specification files is driven by a fundamental architectural shift in the digital pipeline repository:

1. **Conflict with Dynamic Runtime Schema-Driven Architecture**:
   The deleted files contained static, hardcoded domain-specific data structures. In the current design of the digital pipeline, we favor a dynamic, schema-driven model. Storing static domain schemas in markdown backlogs creates duplication of truth and conflicts with schemas defined dynamically at runtime.

2. **Redundant Specifications**:
   The capabilities described in the deleted documents (such as physical structure representation, geographic locations, rack configuration, and chassis containment layouts) are already fully realized and enforced by our generic dynamic layout and form validation engines. Continuing to maintain separate, static documents for these features introduces documentation drift without providing additional functional utility.

## 3. Realization Mapping

| Feature / Domain | Replaced By | Dynamic Enforcement System |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Physical Structural Model** (`feat-06`) | Dynamic Schema Registry | Schema-driven dynamic layout engine |
| **Geographic Location** (`feat-07`) | Form Validation Rules | Dynamic layout geo-location schemas |
| **Rack Infrastructure** (`feat-08`) | Grid/Layout Schemas | Generic forms layout parser |
| **Distributed Chassis Containment** (`feat-09`) | Containment Hierarchies | Dynamic runtime validation framework |
