# Solution Walkthrough: Downstream Baseline Seeding and Compliance Framework

This document outlines the solution design, script descriptions, Project Constitution amendments, Code Realization Table, and baseline verification results for Feature 44.

---

## 1. Overview of Issue #44

Issue #44 introduces the **Downstream Baseline Seeding and Compliance Framework** to enforce architectural consistency, structural conformance, and quality gates across multiple downstream platforms (React and Flutter). Specifically, it aims to:
- **Seed Baseline Templates**: Allow downstream projects to be cleanly bootstrapped with baseline structures while preserving active working states (such as `.git`, `node_modules`, and lockfiles).
- **Enforce Conformance Gates**: Validate type compatibility against mandated domain classes and interfaces, check structural integrity, and verify that compilation and testing suites execute cleanly.
- **Enforce Zero-Mocking**: Require that client-side applications connect to live, persistent databases or emulators in active builds, prohibiting mock/stub repository adapters at the dependency injection level.

## 2. Description of the Bootstrap and Verify Scripts

Two key utility scripts were added to realize Feature 44:

### 2.1. [bootstrap_downstream.py](file:///Users/perkunas/digital-pipeline-repo/scripts/bootstrap_downstream.py)
This script initializes or updates a downstream application (either `react` or `flutter`) by copying baseline template files from the repository's root template folders (`web_react` or `app_flutter`) to a specified destination directory.
- **Preservation Logic**: It surgically avoids overwriting critical working state files and folders at the destination, including `.git`, `node_modules`, `.dart_tool`, `package-lock.json`, `pubspec.lock`, and other package-manager lockfiles.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/bootstrap_downstream.py <platform> <destination_path>
  ```

### 2.2. [verify_downstream_baseline.py](file:///Users/perkunas/digital-pipeline-repo/scripts/verify_downstream_baseline.py)
This compliance validator asserts that a downstream project matches all baseline and structural requirements:
- **Baseline Check**: Asserts that all essential files exist (e.g., `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/types.ts` for React; `pubspec.yaml`, `analysis_options.yaml`, `lib/domain/types.dart`, `lib/domain/validation.dart` for Flutter).
- **Type Compatibility**: Programmatically parses the types file (`types.ts` or `types.dart`) to ensure the presence of all 9 mandated domain classes/interfaces.
- **Build and Test Verification**: Triggers the package manager to fetch dependencies and executes build/compilation and test suites (`npm run build` for React; `flutter pub get && flutter analyze && flutter test` for Flutter).
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/verify_downstream_baseline.py <platform> <destination_path>
  ```

---

## 3. Amendments to the Project Constitution

To make baseline verification a mandatory quality gate for downstream applications, the [Project Constitution](file:///Users/perkunas/digital-pipeline-repo/.pipeline/constitution.md) was amended.

### Section 4.5: Downstream Conformance Gates
The following rules were formally integrated under Section 4:
- Prior to integrating any downstream application implementation, the project **MUST** be bootstrapped and verified.
- The downstream project must be initialized using the [bootstrap_downstream.py](file:///Users/perkunas/digital-pipeline-repo/scripts/bootstrap_downstream.py) script.
- The baseline conformance must be verified using the [verify_downstream_baseline.py](file:///Users/perkunas/digital-pipeline-repo/scripts/verify_downstream_baseline.py) script, which asserts that all baseline files are present, validates type compatibility with the mandated domain classes, and compiles/tests the project with a clean exit code.

Additionally, **Section 5 (Forbidden Practices)** was updated to forbid deleting, disabling, or modifying baseline files, layout splitters, playback timelines, or focus-loss validation forms in downstream projects, as they form the core compliance and verification framework.

## 4. Code Realization Table
