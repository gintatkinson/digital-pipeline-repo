"""Regression tests for issue #323 — install-time tracker label provisioning.

Labels were created just-in-time, at the moment the first issue of a given type was
filed. They arrived eventually, but a freshly installed downstream repository showed an
empty "Filter by labels" dropdown until an orchestrator run had filed one issue of every
type — and a partial run left only `user-story` showing, which reads as a broken
installation rather than an incomplete one.

The taxonomy is known at install time, so discovering it lazily buys nothing.

The just-in-time path in `create_issue.sh` is deliberately kept. It is idempotent and
remains the fallback for a repository provisioned before this script existed, or one
where a label was deleted by hand. Removing it would trade a cosmetic defect for a
functional one, so a test asserts it survives.
