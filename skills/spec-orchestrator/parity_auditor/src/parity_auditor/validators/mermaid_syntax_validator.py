"""Offline checker for the project's documented Mermaid syntax rules.

This is **not** a Mermaid grammar parser. It enforces the character-level rules
consolidated in ``rules/platform-independence.md``, which are the rules that have
actually broken rendering in this repository. A clean result means no *documented
rule* was violated; it does not prove the diagram renders.

That limit is deliberate. The alternative considered was calling a remote renderer,
which was rejected: a blocking gate depending on a third-party service fails when
that service is down or rate-limits, and it ships specification content to a third
party. See ``.pipeline/upstream/pipeline-tooling.md`` § *Validation Gates*.

Rules enforced
--------------
* Semicolons in ``Note`` statements and in message text. Mermaid reads ``;`` as a
  statement separator, so the remainder of the line becomes a new statement and
  collides with whatever follows. This is the fault that shipped on issue #283.
* Unclosed ```` ```mermaid ```` fences.
* Colons inside class-diagram member lines and inside note strings.
* Stereotypes on class-diagram relationship lines (``<<`` ``>>`` ``«`` ``»`` and
  their HTML entities).
* Curly braces inside class-diagram member lines.
* Empty class bodies written on a single line (``class X {}``). A class block is
  opened by ``class X {`` and closed only by a line consisting of ``}``, so the
  same-line brace never closes it; a later ``}`` pops the leaked block and the
  classes after it are silently attached to the wrong namespace. Issue #279.

Deliberately not enforced
-------------------------
* *Attribute-less classes as such.* Only the single-line spelling above is
  rejected. An ancestor container node on a schema containment path frequently has
  no attributes of its own, and the canonical Feature template in
  ``skills/schema-specification-engineering/SKILL.md`` ships one, so a blanket
  prohibition would reject this repository's own template. Semantic emptiness is
  governed elsewhere: the *isolated classes* rule in ``validators/uml.py`` covers
  classes with no relationships, and schema coverage covers unmapped nodes.
* *Participants declared before use.* Mermaid auto-declares participants on first
  reference, so requiring an explicit declaration would reject valid diagrams. A
  checker that produces false positives is worse than no checker.
* *Arrow token validity.* Mermaid accepts a large set of arrow forms; enumerating
  them invites false positives for no demonstrated benefit.
